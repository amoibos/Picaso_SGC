	Arduino PicasoSGC Library:
	============================================================================
	Download latest source of the library at:
	https://github.com/tklenke/Picaso_SGM

	Instalation
	============================================================================
	(I want to make this a library, but I'm having some issues with how to include
	SoftwareSerial correctly.  So for now do the following)
	-Start a new sketch
	-Save sketch with name of your choice...IDE will create a directory with that name
	-Close that IDE window
	-Copy picaso_sgc.cpp and picaso_sgc.h to that sketch's directory
	-Open the IDE and open that project
		picaso_sgc.cpp and picaso_sgc.h should be new tabs in the IDE window.
	-Add following to your sketch
		#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
		#include "picaso_sgc.h"
	

	Tested on the Arduino IDE 1.0, Arduino Uno and 4DSystems µVGA-II(SGC)
